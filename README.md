# Hotel Booking Database System

University Database Systems Project

---

## Project Description

This project implements a relational database system for a Hotel Booking platform.

The project includes:

- Full database schema design
- Data population
- SQL queries
- SQL views
- Final design documentation and analysis

The system models the core functionality of a hotel reservation platform including hotels, rooms, users, reservations, payments, promotions, and related entities.

## Database Overview

The database includes entities such as:

- Hotels
- RoomTypes
- Rooms
- Users
- Guests
- Reservations
- Payments
- Promotions
- Owners
- Amenities
- Inventory

The design follows relational database principles including:

- Primary and foreign keys
- Referential integrity
- Constraints
- Normalization

---

## SQL Components

### 1. Database Dump
`HotelBookingDB_dump.sql`

Includes:
- CREATE TABLE statements
- Constraints and relationships
- INSERT statements with sample data

---

### 2. Views
`HotelBookingDB_views.sql`

Custom views created to simplify complex queries and support reporting functionality.

---

### 3. Queries
Separate SQL files containing assignment queries:

- Data retrieval queries
- Aggregation queries
- Filtering and grouping
- Join operations across multiple tables

Each query demonstrates advanced SQL usage including:
- JOINs
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions

---

## Documentation

The file `final-design.docx` includes:

- ER Diagram
- Schema design explanation
- Assumptions
- Business rules
- Design decisions
- Query explanations

---

## Academic Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- Relational database modeling
- Entity-Relationship design
- SQL implementation
- Complex query development
- View creation
- Data integrity enforcement
